I found another template for my website that I like better so that is good. Innocent and I made a lot of progress on the Disco Tray Studios website. Working on the colors was not fun since there was so many and I had to just kinda scroll and change them. I couldn't figure out how to get the orange border around one of the buttons to go away, and that was very frustrating. But we don't need that button anymore so problem solved. I also got the email working and gave the team some great descriptions because nobody sent me any. I started the blog page, but I'm not super happy with how it looks because there's not much format. Hopefully we'll be done with it by Monday. I'm not sure how the blog is going to work, but I'm going to focus on the suggestions the team had instead of the blog becasue I don't think it's that important.
