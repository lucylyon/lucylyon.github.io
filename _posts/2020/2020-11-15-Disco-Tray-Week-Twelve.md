title:  "Week 12 - Admin Stuff & Broken Website"

I tried to push the changes I've made on the creative branch on the website to the master branch and that was very bad. I tried to do it twice and nothing happened. Then Dr. Goadrich helped and now the website is just a shiny picture, so that's a problem. I'm currently trying to figure out what on earth happened, and hopefully I'll be able to do that before the meeting. Also I've been working with Ivy to do get some of the admin stuff working. I'm glad I'm working on the assessment again, and Ivy is lovely and a genius, so I'm glad we're working together.
