We had our first meeting this week, and it was really nice to be a part of the team again. There is a bunch of stuff everyone is working on, so I’m super excited to work on some new projects. I am so happy that I get to do this again. I've honestly dreaded all of my CS stuff recently, so it's nice to find some joy in it again. Hopefully I’ll be able to work on Good Vibes again! Seeing what everyone has done with it is so neat and brings me so much joy. I’d love to be able to get into it and figure out how it works and hopefully add to it. It’s going to be interesting because I haven’t done much comp sci stuff in the past year, especially not things I’ve actually enjoyed. So hopefully I remember how to do things and I don’t crash and burn. But if I do, everyone is lovely so I’d like to think they will help. 
Last time I did blog posts, I kept track of the weeks, which was a bit of a hassle, so I think this time I shall not do that. The posts will keep track of when I make the posts, so hopefully that will be good enough. And if it is not, I will keep track of those again. I think it would be good to have a specific day that I do my blog entries. Wednesday would be ideal but my wednesday's are so hectic, so I think my plan is Sunday is blog day. We shall see if that actually happens.
