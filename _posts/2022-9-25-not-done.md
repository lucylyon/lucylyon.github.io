I haven't been able to work on Disco Tray stuff much this week because life is very overwhelming. For the past couple semesters, I've had to drop a class after a monthish becuase I am not meant to take 4 classes. However I'm technically only in 3 classes since this isn't a class. However it basically is because I have to do comp sci stuff. So, I have the work load of 4 classes. Not good. This semester I've decided to drop my retaurant job instead of trying to drop a class. I have to finish working there for the rest of september, then I'll probably be off until winter break. I'm hoping to use the time that I would be working on school/Disco Tray stuff becuase they've both been suffering becuase of my stinky job.  <br />
We were supposed to have something to do a demo of for tomorrow, but I still can't get mine to work. I am so stressed and overwhelmed, I do not know if going to the meeting is the best idea tomorrow. Legit worried it'll give me a panic attack. I talked to the other people in my team and they are so nice and lovely and said it is okay.  <br />
Also, I feel behind in all of my classes, so I'm not going to push myself to work on Disco Tray stuff as much. Hopefully I'll find a grove for my classes since I won't have as much to balance with job, Disco Tray, and classes. This week is just survival mode. Another reason I've also been putting off Disco Tray is because it stresses me out to not know what I'm doing (even though the point of this whole college thing is to learn).
