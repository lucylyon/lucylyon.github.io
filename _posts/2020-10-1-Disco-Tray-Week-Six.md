I was supposed to work with Innocent to continue integrating the database and the website, but we were both confused so not much was accomplished. I reached out to Dr. Goadrich and he said there was some other stuff I could work on, so I did that instead. I finished the main blog post about why the name Disco Tray Studios, and I'm working on a new post for adding dates in My Life In Months. I also plan on spending some time this next week just learning more about sql. Dr. Goadrich was working on adding a way to sign in, and I tried to work on it, but I got stuck pretty quickly. Today during the meeting we did sql queries and it kinda made sense, and I think working with Griffith and Innocent will be beneficial because Innocent knows a lot about the website, and Griffith knows a lot about the database. Hopefully I'll be able to pick up things from both of them. For some reason I thought this would get more manageble the further in the semester we got, but each week it seems like everyone is speaking a language I don't understand. I felt good about working on the Disco Tray Studios website, but I've been lost during the whole HDX Assesment chunk.
