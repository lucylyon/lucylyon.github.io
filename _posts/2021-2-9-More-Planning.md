I think we are going to end up using Firebase to store users, so hopefully, that goes well. I met with Ivy and planned some of the functionality of the app, and she made mock ups of the UI. Android Studios crashed on my laptop last semester, so I need to fix that soon. I thought I could use Visual Studio code, but I can only create emulators through Android Studios. I borrowed a tablet from Dr. Ferrer in hopes that that would solve some problems. It didn't. I think I'm going to have to fix Android Studios and I am not excited. Back in November, something went wrong and now I can't even open it. Dr. Ferrer and I spent hours trying to fix it last semester, but nothing worked. Last semester I gave up and downloaded everything on my dad's computer and used that. However I am not at home, and that isn't sustainable anyway, so I need to figure out how to run Android Studios on my laptop again. I have uninstalled/reinstalled Android Studios and Flutter countless times. At one point I deleted Intellij because apparently they are connected, and that didn't work. I have deleted so many files and redownloaded a lot of them again too. I have absolutely no idea what happened, so I have no clue how I am going to fix it. I am not excited.
