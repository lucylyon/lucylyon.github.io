beep boop update this one. 
I’ve been trying to abstract the names. What happens if I put stuff in a post that already exists?? Why isnt this working. So when it shows all of the messages and stuff it will be the actual list of users instead of the stuff I hard coded in. It is not going very well. I’ve made the ‘todo’ list with the list of users. However flutter did not want to acknowledge that the list exists outside of the class it was created in. But I need it in other classes. So that was bad news. I realized I needed to query stuff, and I think I’ll be able to access stuff through queries. This is interesting because I still don't really understand databases so I’m having to learn how to create/use a sql database but through flutter. However we got the Conversation List page to show the users of the database, which was massive progress! I'm super excited about that, but I still have no clue how to query stuff.
