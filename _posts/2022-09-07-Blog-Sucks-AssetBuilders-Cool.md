I still cannot get my blog to run. Starting from scratch also might not be the best idea. For some reason I don't
have permission to install stuff?? On my own computer??? I've made a little progress, but every time I try 
to run the website locally it yells at me. Also even if I push stuff to github, it won't update on the actual 
website. Which is very weird becuase the commits have the little green checkmark by them. But they still don't 
want to work. 
Anyways. We're picking up Arkansas Asset Builders from the Databases course last fall. I am very excited to work 
on it becuase I need more database practice. I took a database course when I was abroad, but it was more 
datamining instead of databasey stuff. It was a cool class, but I didn't learn as much as I was hoping. We met
with Dr. Yorgey's wife on Friday, and she gave us some ideas on what she wants. It's gonna be interesting 
to see how it comes through.
