I improved the use cases for Good Vibes. Last week I just wrote some notes, which made sense to me, but they weren't super helpful if people don't have my brain. I fleshed them out and made it more comprehensive and flow better instead of random bullet points. It's really neat seeing my app idea change over time and hopefully get implemented (again). After I did that, it was time to start working on the app. However, I still can't because Flutter hates me. I finally got Android Studios to open, but Flutter is another beast. In order to get Android Studios to open, I had to create a new user on my laptop. Thankfully whatever bug I have didn't transfer to the new account. I redownloaded GitKraken, Flutter, and Android Studios onto the new user, but Android Studios still wouldn't open. I forgot Android Studios is based off on IntelliJ, so I had to download that, then Android Studios opened! Hopefully, I can get Flutter running soon because I need it very much.
