I met with Innocent and planned some ideas for Good Vibes. Last semester we used peer to peer connection, but that is not sustainable in the long run, so we brainstormed some new ideas. The goal was to find a way that doesn't use a server, but I do not think that is possible unfortunaly. My group used firebase last semester to make accounts for an app, and that was okay. Created users was relativly straightforward, but once we tried to store more information attached to the user, that did not go well. Hopefully we figure out something reasonable.
