I feel like I have a much better understanding of this project becuase of this week. I've been working with Griffith on the database, and I think I understand how everything is connected now. We're working on adding some new stuff so we have one entry in the database for each survey, as well as an entry for each submission and response. This is going to make it easier to look at all the questions for a specific professor and their class. Also on Thursday, we spent most of the meeting drawing out a diagram of what we want this project to do. It was really helpful becuase we just did it bit by bit, so it was much easier to understand. I feel like it took me way too long to grasp this project, but I'm glad that I finally understand it. Our first deadline is next monday, and I'm curious to see what the whole project looks semi put together.
