title:  "Week 4 - Formatting Blog & Starting HDX Assessment Database"

This week was very overwhelming for the rest of my classes/life stuff, so Disco Tray Studios got put on the backburner. Dr. Goadrich and I formatted the blog on the website to look better, and I'm really happy with how the whole website turned out. This week I'm working with Griffith for the Hendrix Assessment Database. I think this will be really helpful. Databases seem like something I should know more about, so this will be a good learning experience for me. It's nice working in a team rather than a class because I'm seeing what we do actually get used. Also it's easier working one on one with someone instead of in a class. I find it's easier to ask questions to other people in the team than it is in my official classes. This week should be less hectic than last week, so hopefully I'll be able to get a lot more work done.
