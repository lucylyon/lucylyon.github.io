We had our first meeting this week, and it was really nice to be a part of the team again. There is a 
bunch of stuff everyone is working on, so I’m super excited to work on some new projects. I am so happy
that I get to do this again. I've honestly dreaded all of my CS stuff recently, so it's nice to find 
some joy in it again. Hopefully I’ll be able to work on Good Vibes again! Seeing what everyone has
done with it is so neat and brings me so much joy. I’d love to be able to get into it and figure out 
how it works and hopefully add to it. It’s going to be interesting because I haven’t done much comp 
sci stuff in the past year, especially not things I’ve actually enjoyed. So hopefully I remember how 
to do things and I don’t crash and burn. But if I do, everyone is lovely so I’d like to think they 
will help. 
Last time I did blog posts, I kept track of the weeks, which was a bit of a hassle, so I think this time 
I shall not do that. The posts will keep track of when I make the posts, so hopefully that will be good. 
And if it is not, I will keep track of those again. I think it would be good to have a specific day that
I do my blog entries. Wednesday would be ideal but my wednesday's are so hectic, so I think my plan is
Sunday is blog day. We shall see if that actually happens. 
Well. It is going poorly. I cannot remember my password to github so I can't log in. <br />
Update: Remembered password, but now it won't let me push things. This is going to be a long year. I am giving up for now. This is a future problem. <br /> 
Future me speaking: There are a bunch of issues with the dependencies, so I'm going to try to start from scratch. And
then I can get a new theme! This is taking much longer than expected. I've gotten a new laptop since last time,
so I have to re install everything. And I forgot how much stuff that actually is. For some reason I don't
have permission to install some of the stuff? Which makes no sense.
