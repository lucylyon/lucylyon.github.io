Stupid blog still isn't working. I'm meeting with Goadrich tomorrow and hopefully we can figure something out. 
I should've gotten help sooner, but oh well. 
We've decided to change plans for the Assset Builders stuff. We're gonna use JavaFX, but I'm not quite
sure how. I wasn't able to go to the meeting, so Olivia filled me in on the gist of it. JavaFX was the 
project I did the worst on in Data Structures, so now I get to re figure that out again. I think I figured 
out how to do it for the final project of that class? We shall see what all I remember becuase that was 
two and a half years ago. Also I've gotten a new laptop since then, so I get to download more things. Woo.
At this point I am so tired of downloading new things, I might go to the snoddy center becuase all the
laptops in there have functional versions of javafx and scenebuilder, and I do not. I would rather jump
into the actual project and get everything situated on my computer later, instead of wasting a bunch
of time now on trying to get everything setup. <br />
I met with Goadrich for my blog, and turns out I was using the default version of ruby that was installed.
We got it fixed, and now I'm able to make more progress. Hopefully this thing will be running soon. I'm 
tired of setting stuff up.
