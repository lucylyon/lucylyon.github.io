Okay. So. I have no idea if anyone will ever read this, but if you are. Hello. I hope you are having a lovely day. Let me tell you a little bit of backstory. During college, I was a part of Disco Tray Studios (link).  Part of that adventure included making weekly blog posts. It was a way for our instructor to keep up with what work we were doing, as well as what was happening with our classes/life. 

Back to now. I have graduated from Hendrix, therefor leaving our crew :(. Now it is time for me to get a big kid job, and having a decent website is good advertisement for myself. However, I decided to make this website a few days before I leave the country for 5 weeks… So this website is not the best, but it’s better than nothing. I do not want to think about the ‘real world’ while I am traveling, so once I leave, I will (probably) not touch this website until I return. Maybe I’ll apply for some jobs on my phone and send recruiters this website. If that is the case, hello again, please hire me. If you’ve made it this far, I think you legally have to give me a job (this is a joke, but what if it wasn’t).

Also, I think it would be cool if I had a little travel part of my website. But man I do not think there’s time for that before I leave. So maybe you’ll see that. Maybe you won’t. 

Anyways. Love you. Goodbye for now (or forever. That is up to you) <3
