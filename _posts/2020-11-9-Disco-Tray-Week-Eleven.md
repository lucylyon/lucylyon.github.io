I figured out more of the youtube and twitter stuff. For twitter we have to click a link and it'll take us to a premade tweet, but I don't think it will automatically tweet. It's similar with youtube. We have to manually export the videos after each stream. So either that can be part of the streaming process, or like once a week I can go through and export all the streams for the previous week. I think I might just export them whenever I remember so I don't get behind and end up losing some of the streams. I've also been working on our website this week, and I really enjoy it. I like working on it because there's always something to do, and it's not as difficult as the HDX assessment stuff, but I still get to code. I've been a lot more productive this week than I have in the past few weeks and I really hope I can continue to actually have motivation. I'm figuring out get the Docker set up which I'm excited for so I can be at least a little involved in the assessment. I've wanted to get back into helping for it but I'm worried I'll get overwhelemed again, so this is a good compromise.
