I was able to get the simple database working in good vibes, so that’s progress. Now is the hard part of figuring how on earth to abstract it. It currently iterates for each new user, but I need to make it to where I can give each user a number instead. Also, the tutorial was for a todo list so I made that exactly then tried to change it to a user list and it got very mad. The only thing I changed was variable names, so I have no clue why it didn’t work?? I decided it’s not worth fighting right now, so I’m just going to work with a todo list for now but try to make it have all of the elements of a chat user.  I also got the fonts to finally work! I couldn’t figure out how to import custom fonts, but I got google fonts to work. There’s a bajillion google fonts so I’ve decided that is good enough. I made a few mockups of different font styles and combinations.
