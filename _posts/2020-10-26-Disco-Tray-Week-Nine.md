I've been playing around with Twitch, and trying to figure out what all I need to actually stream. I think I have everything all figured out, and I'll start streaming next week! I'm very interested to see how streaming goes. I connected our twitter, facebook and youtube so twitch can post when we're streaming and save the videos once we're done. I also put in a link to our website if anyone wants to check that out. I added a schedule so people can know when we're streaming and who's streaming. Next week is going to be interesting to see how streaming actually goes. I've done some test streams, but not actual ones where I play a game or anything.
