I was finally able to get flutter working on my computer last week, so I was able to start on the UI for Good Vibes! I have been able to work on it quite a bit, and I am really enjoying it. It's nice to work on something I understand for once. I'm a little worried about working on it once the UI is to a decent point. I was supposed to try to get some of the back-end stuff working this week, but I spent most of my time on the UI. However, I've gotten a lot of the basic stuff implemented that I wanted. This week I got the bottom nav bar to work which was lovely. It was working in the beginning but I changed so much stuff I had to completely re-do it twice. The last time I redid it, I created a new app and started from scratch. That way I didn't have to deal with everything else going on in the app and try to connect it. Once I got a basic bottom nav page working, I was able to see what I did wrong on Good Vibes. I copied most of the code over and made some changes to get everything to connect, and it worked! I also got the url launcher to work, which was nice. For some reason, it always throws a fit whenever you first import it. Overall I'm delighted with how the UI looks so far. For the first time in a while, I was excited to show the team what I had been working on.
