I just did my first stream today! I thought I had the right software but apparently I need to download more. The chat wasn't showing up on my computer so I had to switch between Twitch and the game. I got the background and stuff to look like Dr. Goadrich's so there has been some progress figuring out streaming. And I think I only have to set that up once. I forgot to change the title of the stream so it was the same as Dr. Goadrich's from yesterday, so I need to fix that. I was unable to see the chat while I was streaming, so I think I need to have the game on my computer and the twitch layout on the monitor so I can see if anyone is chatting. Abbi and Dr. Goadrich watched my stream! So that was nice. I thought the twitter was working but apparently Dr. Goadrich was tweeting, so I work on that some more and figure out what I missed.
