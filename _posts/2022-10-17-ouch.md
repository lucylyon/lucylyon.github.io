Wowie it has been a week. On Monday I got to talk to freshman about Good Vibes. I do not know how that went. I think it went okay? I feel like I didn’t say enough and they did not care that much. Also while messing with the app, I realzied the suicide hotline number is wrong. Also when you’re in dark mode and try to call the number, the text in the popup is white, and so is the background, so nothing is there. But, the number still works. I tried to change it but when I cloned the repo there was so many red lines, and I decided it is a future problem. Also I am not sure if I was on the right branch. Also my roommate can’t get Good Vibes because it is not on the Google Play store :( . <br />
Good news! We have a CSV parser! I finally did something useful. It took me way too long to do it, but we have it now. Now I have to figure out how to actually export our data. That will be hard. Also, I had to leave the wednesday meeting a little early, but I found out I have ADHD. However, I have had a really bad reaction to my new meds, so I have kinda been unable to function for a few days. This semester is very hard. I do not like it.
