This week Innocent and I started working on the website. We spent a while looking 
for themes and testing them out. I found a couple themes that I liked, but the first
one wouldn't run on my computer and I didn't like the format of the second one after
I actually got it up and running. I found another one and started to get it running,
but I ran 'bundle exec jekyll _3.3.0_ new . --force', which was a bad idea because 
it overran everything so I couldn't actually work on the template. As it turns out,
Innocent was working on basically the same template, so I found a new one. I really
like the final template, and I've finally figured how to edit it. I was editing 
the wrong index file for a while, which was very frustrating. I had a meeting with 
Dr. Goadrich and he explained what I was doing wrong, and after that it was pretty 
much smooth sailing. I didn't get much time to work on this blog because I was so 
focused on the website for Disco Tray Studios.  Hopefully I'll be able to find another 
template that I like so this blog isn't just white and boring.
